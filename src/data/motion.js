        InfoSlide: "The Military-Industrial Complex (MIC) refers to the intricate and often symbiotic relationship between a nation's military establishment, its government, and the private defense industries that supply weapons and military technology. This concept, famously coined by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower in his 1961 farewell address, highlights the potential for this powerful alliance to exert undue influence on public policy, defense spending, and international relations. It suggests a vested interest in maintaining high levels of military expenditure and, at times, in perpetuating conflict, as it benefits all parties involved.",

        InfoSlide:" The samurai were warriors of the Japanese Empire, known for following a strict code of honor, Bushido, which demands from the samurai love for their nation, even at the cost of their own life in combat. Among other principles, Bushido values loyalty, courage, and honor. To this end, war should be just and straightforward, with strategies such as ambushes, betrayals, or traps outside open and honest confrontation being morally inadmissible. A dishonored samurai could suffer severe punishments, such as isolation, expulsion from service, and loss of citizenship. Infoslide 2: You are a samurai of the Japanese Empire and have been trained since childhood to fight following Bushido. However, your native island is about to be invaded by Mongol troops, known for their brutality, numerical superiority, and more advanced weaponry. This is not the first battle in which you face a militarily superior enemy; still, you know this will be a difficult battle, and your nation is gripped by apprehension and despair."

        motion:"This house, as Chonky, would take the job",
        InfoSlide:"In 1942, Dr. Chonky is an unemployed theoretical physicist and is offered a job developing a new category of atomic weapons (seemingly not prohibited by any treaty). Chonky has always been strongly opposed to weapons of mass destruction, but jobs are scarce and Chonky has a family to provide for. Chonky's spouse makes a very modest salary as a preschool teacher, and has no qualms about Chonky working on these new weapons. If Chonky does not take the job, they are told that Dr. Tairanosaur, someone without any reservations about the weapons research, will take the job and will likely move the development ahead more quickly."
